# Multiple Microphone Test - PCB Design

Welcome to the Multiple Microphone Test repository! This project focuses on the development of a versatile PCB containing various types of microphones, including electret omnidirectional, unidirectional, and MEMS, coupled with an analog preamplification stage.

## Project Overview

This repository houses the design files and documentation for a specialized PCB that serves as a cape for both PocketBeagle and Bela's cape (Bela mini board). The primary function of the circuit is to capture high-quality sound signals using the analog IOs on PocketBeagle, while also integrating a LiPo battery recharging system for enhanced portability and convenience.

## Key Features

- **Microphone Diversity:** The PCB features different types of microphones to accommodate various recording scenarios and preferences, ensuring flexibility and adaptability in capturing audio.

- **Analog Preamplification:** An integrated analog preamplification stage enhances the quality and fidelity of captured sound signals, optimizing them for further processing and analysis.

- **Compatibility:** Designed as a cape for both PocketBeagle and Bela's cape (Bela mini board), this PCB offers seamless integration with these platforms, expanding their capabilities in sound capture and processing.

- **LiPo Battery Support:** The inclusion of a LiPo battery recharging system enhances the portability and longevity of the device, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from field recording to live performances.
